# LaTeX-and-Asy
Some of my .sty and .asy files as well as files made by other people that I use.

Notes:
- NTforTeXit.tex is a small package made for LaTeX bots on Discord, which have limitations on what packages are allowed
- With version 3.0, we now have NotesTemplateF.sty, which can be used more easily with .Rmd files using the tiny LaTeX installation
